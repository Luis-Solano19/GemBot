So this bot has the intention of iterate over inventory bags in a game, then it checks every cubby in the inventory to look for a gem.
If it founds a stack of gems, then it will "melt" all of them except one (this with the purpose of maintaining gems organized on my inventory)
if it found just one, it will skip it and if it founds something that's not a gem, then it will skip it too.


Bwt im not saying the name of the game for privacy purposes and i have to state that:

- I HAVE NEVER AND WILL NEVER DISTRIBUTE THIS BOT TO OTHER USERS WITHING THE GAME NOR WILL I SEEK TO MAKE ANY MONETARY INCOME OFF OF IT.
- I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN ANY MONETARY INCOMES OFF OF THIS BOT.
- I HAVEN NOT CREATED THIS BUT WITH ILLEGAL PURPOSES (Just to make my gaming experience better).
