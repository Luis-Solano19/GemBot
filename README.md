So this bot has the intention of iterate over inventory bags in a game, then it checks every cubby in the inventory to look for a gem.
If it founds a stack of gems, then it will "melt" all of them except one (this with the purpose of maintaining gems organized on my inventory)
if it found just one, it will skip it and if it founds something that's not a gem, then it will skip it too.
