This bot iterates over inventory bags in a game, then it checks every cubby in the inventory to look for a gem.
If it finds a stack of gems, then it will "melt" all of them except one (this with purpose of maintaining gems organized on my inventory),
if it finds just one, it will skip it and in case of finding something that's not a gem, then it will skip it too.
